  Hi, I'm Palettizer bot!

  If you're an artist, I can tell you what colors and how much of them you need to paint anything - just give me a photo or sketch.
  Currently I support several color palettes from large paint manufacturers:
    - Montana Black (ID mtnblack)
    - Montana 94 (ID mtn94)
    - Arton (ID arton)
    - Tikkurila (ID tikkurila)

  How to use me:
    - Attach your sketch to the message
    - Write the palette IDs you need separated by comma (see the full list above)
    - Write the maximum number of colors you'd like to use, if needed
    - Examples:
       arton,mtn94
       arton,mtn94 15
       mtnblack,mtn94
       tikkurila 50
    - Send the message and wait a couple of minutes. I'll pick up the colors for you.
